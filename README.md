# FACE RECOGNITION
This work was done for my **course completion work (TCC)**
and is specific for **facial recognition** and **detection** using the **Viola-Jones**, **Eigenface** and **Fisherface algorithms**.

This **algorithm is manual** because it was created for the presentation of the course conclusion paper, and it was divided into three steps, which are:

1) **Capture (capture.py)**
2) **Training (training.py)**
3) **Facial Recognition (eigenface.py and or fisherface.py)**

Two caps had been left, which are:

1) **viola-jones-1.py**
2) **viola-jones-2.py**

Where it is possible to "play" a little with face detection and its parameters.


**This algorithm was programmed by me: THIAGO DE BONIS CARVALHO SAAD SAUD**
